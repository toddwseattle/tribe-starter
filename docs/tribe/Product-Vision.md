- The app is called Timer Turn

# Users

- Users are software development teams who do mob programming with drivers and navigators.

# Value proposition

An easy to use rotation timer for managing and tracking mob programming sessions.

# Key features

Simple mobile-friendly one-screen design with the app name at the top, and below it:

- large countdown timer, defaulting to 10 minutes, but adjustable at the start of each session,
- a single start/pause buttonm
- the team members, shuffled at the start of each session, with the first name highlighted
  Simple operations:
- Tap a name to skip or include that team member in the rotation.
- Tap start to start the timer, tap again to pause it.
- When one minute is left, timer beeps and starts flashing.
- When time is up, timer sounds an alarm, resets time, rotates to the next team member, and waits for start.
  Recording-keeping:
- At end of each turn, the app logs to the console the current time, rotation duration setting, the driver, and the navigators.

# Example scenario

Here is an example session.

- Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Dave are a team of developers.
- Alice, Cathy, and Dave meet to do mob programming for 90 minutes.
- Alice starts the app on her phone.
- It shows a countdown timer, set to 10 minutes, a start button, and a shuffled list of team member names with checkmarks.
- The first name is highlighted. It happens to be Bob.
- Alice taps Bob's nam because he is not there. The highlight moves to Dave.
- Dave sits at the keyboard and starts the timer. He begins entering code suggested by the other team members.
- Pizza arrives, so Dave stops the timer and grabs a slice. After a few minutes, he starts the timer to continue his turn.
- A beep at 9 minutes warns the team is almost time to rotate.
- Whem time goes to zero, an alarm sounds. Dave stops. The highlight moves to Cathy
- Cathy taps the start button to begin her turn.
